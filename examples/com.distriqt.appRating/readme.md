Animate CC Example: 

Sample includes UI and functionality to support rating the application for the App Stores.

Folder project structure:

ANE (air native extensions)
iosSDK (sdk to use when testing the review controller)
src (project folder)
- includes (actionscript include files to separate code by function)
- appRating.fla (UI and core project code)
- appRating-app.xml (project export settings for iOS and android)
- Default-XXX.pngs (these images are used to scale the project to the correct resolution for the ios devices and also provide a launch image for the application while it is loading)

Animate CC Example: 

Sample includes UI and functionality to communicate between devices using bluetooth LE. You can set up your device as a Peripheral (device that is the source) or a Central (devices that get data from source).

Folder project structure:

ANE (air native extensions)
src (project folder)
- includes (actionscript include files to separate code by function)
- bluetoothLE.fla (UI and core project code)
- bluetoothLE-app.xml (project export settings for iOS and android)
- Default-XXX.pngs (these images are used to scale the project to the correct resolution for the ios devices and also provide a launch image for the application while it is loading)
